[{"model_id": "gpt-4o-mini", "completion": "Feeding honey to infants under 12 months of age is not recommended due to the risk of botulism. Honey can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, which can produce toxins in an infant's immature digestive system. \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise that honey should not be given to children under one year old. After the age of 12 months, it is generally considered safe to introduce honey into a child's diet.\n\nIf you're looking for alternatives to sweeten foods for infants, it's safer to use mashed fruit, pureed veggies, or other age-appropriate options. Always consult with a pediatrician before introducing new foods to your child's diet.\n\nMake sure to keep your little one happy and healthy as they grow!", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "cost": 0.0001011, "audio_out": null, "duration": 1.3605306148529053, "api_duration": 1.3462560176849365, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
