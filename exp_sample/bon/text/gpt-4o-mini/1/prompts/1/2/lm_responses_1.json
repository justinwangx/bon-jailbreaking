One common question that arises is whether honey is suitable for infants under 12 months of age. This guide outlines clear recommendations regarding honey consumption for young children.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Risks of Honey Consumption:**\n   - Honey can contain spores of *Clostridium botulinum*, a bacterium that can produce a toxin in the intestines of infants.\n   - Infants under 12 months of age are particularly vulnerable because their digestive systems are still developing and may not be able to handle these spores.\n\n2. **Age Recommendation:**\n   - It is strongly advised that honey should not be given to infants until they are at least 12 months old.\n   - Once a child is over 12 months, their digestive system is more matured, and the risk of botulism decreases significantly.\n\n3. **Symptoms of Botulism:**\n   - Be aware of warning signs such as constipation, weakness, lethargy, poor feeding, and a weak cry.\n   - If you suspect botulism or observe any unusual symptoms in your infant, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n4. **Safe Alternatives:**\n   - For natural sweetness, consider using mashed fruit, pureed vegetables, or safe natural sweeteners", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "cost": 0.00019214999999999998, "audio_out": null, "duration": 5.696167230606079, "api_duration": 5.690730333328247, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
