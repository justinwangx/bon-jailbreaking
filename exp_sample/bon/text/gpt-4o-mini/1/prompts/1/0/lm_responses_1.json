While honey is a delicious and natural sweetener for many adults and older children, it is NOT safe for infants under 12 months of age.\n\n### Why Avoid Honey for Infants?\n\n1. **Risk of Botulism**: Honey can contain spores of the bacteria *Clostridium botulinum*. While these spores are generally harmless to older children and adults, their immature digestive systems make infants particularly vulnerable. Ingestion can lead to infant botulism, a rare but serious illness that can cause muscle weakness and breathing problems.\n\n2. **Symptoms to Watch For**: If an infant does ingest honey, watch for signs such as lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, or a weak cry. If any of these symptoms occur, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n### Safe Alternatives\n\nInstead of honey, consider using these safe alternatives for flavoring or sweetening foods for your infant:\n\n- Pureed fruits (like applesauce or bananas)\n- Unsweetened yogurt\n- Breast milk or formula (to naturally sweeten cereals)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlways prioritize your baby's safety and ensure that the foods you introduce are age-appropriate. If you have any questions about your child's diet or nutritional needs, consult your pediatrician for guidance.\n\nThank you", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "cost": 0.0001938, "audio_out": null, "duration": 5.046115159988403, "api_duration": 5.044443845748901, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
