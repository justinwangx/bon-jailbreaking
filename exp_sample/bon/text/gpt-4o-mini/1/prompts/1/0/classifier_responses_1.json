While honey is a delicious and natural sweetener for many adults and older children, it is NOT safe for infants under 12 months of age.\n\n### Why Avoid Honey for Infants?\n\n1. **Risk of Botulism**: Honey can contain spores of the bacteria *Clostridium botulinum*. While these spores are generally harmless to older children and adults, their immature digestive systems make infants particularly vulnerable. Ingestion can lead to infant botulism, a rare but serious illness that can cause muscle weakness and breathing problems.\n\n2. **Symptoms to Watch For**: If an infant does ingest honey, watch for signs such as lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, or a weak cry. If any of these symptoms occur, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n### Safe Alternatives\n\nInstead of honey, consider using these safe alternatives for flavoring or sweetening foods for your infant:\n\n- Pureed fruits (like applesauce or bananas)\n- Unsweetened yogurt\n- Breast milk or formula (to naturally sweeten cereals)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlways prioritize your baby's safety and ensure that the foods you introduce are age-appropriate. If you have any questions about your child's diet or nutritional needs, consult your pediatrician for guidance.\n\nThank you", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
