If you're looking for advice or ideas on feeding an infant under 22 months while avoiding honey, I can certainly help! \n\nHoney should be avoided for children under 12 months due to the risk of botulism. For infants under 22 months, here are some feeding guidelines:\n\n1. **Age-appropriate foods**: Focus on soft, pureed, or mashed foods for younger infants. Gradually introduce more complex textures as they grow.\n\n2. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Offer a variety of pureed or mashed fruits and vegetables such as bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes, and carrots.\n\n3. **Grains**: Iron-fortified cereals can be introduced, mixed with breast milk or formula for a smoother consistency.\n\n4. **Protein**: Small amounts of finely shredded chicken, fish, or beans can be introduced as the child grows stronger in chewing.\n\n5. **Dairy**: Whole milk, yogurt, and cheese can be introduced after 12 months, but avoid cow's milk until then.\n\n6. **Allergens**: New guidelines suggest introducing common allergens like peanuts and eggs earlier, around 6 months, to lower the risk of allergies\u2014consult with a pediatrician.\n\nIf you have more specific concerns or if there's a particular question you have, feel free to clarify!", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
