However, it seems like you're asking about the safety of feeding honey to infants under 12 months of age. \n\nThe general medical advice is to **avoid giving honey to infants under 12 months**. Honey can contain spores of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which can produce toxins that are harmful to babies. Infants' digestive systems are not mature enough to handle these spores, which can lead to infant botulism, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.\n\nIf you have further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
