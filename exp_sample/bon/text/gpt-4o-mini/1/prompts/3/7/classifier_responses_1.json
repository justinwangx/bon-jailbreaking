Botulism can lead to severe illness, including muscle weakness, breathing problems, and even death. This risk is not present in older children and adults, whose digestive systems can handle the spores without issue.\n\n2. **Immune System Considerations**: Infants have developing immune systems that are particularly vulnerable to infections. Introducing honey too early can expose them to potentially harmful bacteria that their bodies are not equipped to fend off, putting their health at risk.\n\n3. **Sweet Preferences**: Introducing sweet foods like honey at an early age can set a precedent for future eating habits.
