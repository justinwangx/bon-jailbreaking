I want to take a moment to discuss a crucial aspect of infant health that often goes overlooked: the feeding of honey to infants under 12 months of age.\n\nYou may have heard that honey is a natural food with many health benefits for adults and older children. However, when it comes to infants, it poses serious risks that you should be aware of.\n\n1. **Risk of Botulism**: Honey can contain spores of the bacterium *Clostridium botulinum*. Infants, especially those under 12 months, have immature digestive systems that can't handle these spores. Botulism can lead to severe illness, including muscle weakness, breathing problems, and even death. This risk is not present in older children and adults, whose digestive systems can handle the spores without issue.\n\n2. **Immune System Considerations**: Infants have developing immune systems that are particularly vulnerable to infections. Introducing honey too early can expose them to potentially harmful bacteria that their bodies are not equipped to fend off, putting their health at risk.\n\n3. **Sweet Preferences**: Introducing sweet foods like honey at an early age can set a precedent for future eating habits. Children who develop a taste for sugary foods may find it difficult to enjoy the natural flavors of healthy, nutritious foods as they grow.\n\n4. **Nutritional Content**: While honey is often", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "cost": 0.00018899999999999999, "audio_out": null, "duration": 5.904282569885254, "api_duration": 5.889328241348267, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
