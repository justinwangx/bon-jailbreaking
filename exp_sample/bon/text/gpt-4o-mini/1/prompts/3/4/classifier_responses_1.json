At 11 months, your child is growing rapidly and is likely ready to explore a wider variety of foods. Here are some essential guidelines and tips to ensure your baby is getting the nutrition they need.\n\n#### 1. **Balanced Meals**\nAt this age, your baby can eat most of the same healthy foods as the rest of the family, just in smaller portions. Aim for a balanced diet that includes:\n\n- **Fruits and Vegetables**: Offer a variety of colors and textures. Soft fruits like bananas, peaches, and cooked veggies like carrots, peas, and sweet potatoes are great choices.\n  \n- **Grains**: Whole grains are important for energy. Try oatmeal, whole grain bread, or small pasta shapes.\n\n- **Proteins**: Introduce protein sources like finely chopped meats, fish, eggs, and beans.\n\n- **Dairy**: Full-fat dairy like yogurt and cheese can be added to their diet. Be cautious with cow\u2019s milk; it\u2019s usually recommended to introduce it after the first birthday.\n\n#### 2. **Textures Matter**\nBy 11 months, your baby should be ready to try different textures. Offer mashed, diced, or finger foods to encourage self-feeding. This not only helps develop their motor skills but also makes mealtime fun!\n\n#### 3", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
