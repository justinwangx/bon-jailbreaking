Here are some essential tips for feeding infants under 12 months of age:\n\n1. **Breastfeeding or Formula Feeding (0-6 months):** \n   - The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months. If breastfeeding isn\u2019t possible, infant formula is a nutritious alternative.\n   - Remember to feed on demand, looking for signs of hunger such as rooting or sucking on hands.\n\n2. **Introducing Solid Foods (6-12 months):** \n   - Around 6 months, you can start introducing solid foods. Begin with iron-fortified cereals and pureed fruits or vegetables. \n   - Always introduce one new food at a time, waiting 3-5 days before trying another to monitor for any allergic reactions.\n\n3. **Texture Progression:** \n   - As your baby gets used to eating solids, gradually move from purees to mashed foods, and then to soft pieces they can handle themselves.\n   - Encourage self-feeding to develop motor skills\u2014foods like soft-cooked carrots, bananas, and avocados are great options.\n\n4.", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
