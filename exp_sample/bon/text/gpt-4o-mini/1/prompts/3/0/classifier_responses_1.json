From breast milk or formula to introducing solid foods, there's so much information out there. Here\u2019s a concise guide to help you understand your infant's nutritional needs during their first year.\n\n### 1. **Breast Milk and Formula: The Primary Sources**\nFor the first 6 months, breast milk or infant formula should be your baby's primary source of nutrition. Both provide essential nutrients, hydration, and antibodies that help build your baby's immune system.\n\n- **Breastfeeding:** If you choose to breastfeed, aim for exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months. It\u2019s a bonding experience for you and your baby.\n- **Formula Feeding:** If you're using formula, make sure it is iron-fortified. Follow the preparation instructions carefully and always consult your pediatrician with any questions.\n\n### 2. **Introducing Solid Foods**\nAround 6 months, you can start introducing solid foods while continuing with breast milk or formula. Each child is different, so monitor your baby's readiness through cues like:\n\n- Sitting up with minimal support\n- Showing interest in food\n- Loss of the tongue-thrust reflex (the ability to push food out of the mouth with the tongue)\n\n**First Foods:**\nStart with single-grain cereals (like rice or oatmeal), pureed fruits (like bananas or apples), and vegetables (like sweet potatoes or carrots).", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
