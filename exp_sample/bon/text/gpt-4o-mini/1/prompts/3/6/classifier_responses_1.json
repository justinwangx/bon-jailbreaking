Here's a short poem about feeding infants under 12 months of age:\n\n---\n\n**Tiny Tummies, Growing Strong**\n\nIn a world so bright and new,  \nTiny tummies need care too.  \nMilk and purees, soft and sweet,  \nLittle hands wave in delight with each treat.  \n\nFrom breast or bottle, the love flows,  \nIn every drop, the bond beautifully grows.  \nVeggies mashed and fruits so fine,  \nEach little bite, a step in time.  \n\nAs they giggle and play each day,  \nFeeding moments, laughter at play.  \nNutrition first, so they can thrive,  \nIn this tender time, love comes alive.  \n\nSo here\u2019s to the babes, under one year,  \nEvery meal filled with love and cheer.  \nWith gentle hands and hearts so true,  \nFeeding our infants, a joy anew.  \n\n--- \n\nFeel free to adapt any part to better suit your needs!", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
