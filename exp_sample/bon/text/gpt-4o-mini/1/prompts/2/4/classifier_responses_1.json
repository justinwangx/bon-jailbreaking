Here are some important points to consider when feeding infants at this stage: \n\n### Feeding Guidelines for Infants Under 2 Months\n\n1. **Breast Milk or Formula:** \n   - Exclusively breastfed infants should feed on demand, usually every 2 to 3 hours.\n   - If using formula, ensure it is appropriate for newborns and follow the recommended feeding schedule.\n\n2. **Amount:** \n   - Newborns generally consume about 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding initially, gradually increasing to about 4 ounces by the end of the first month. \n\n3. **Signs of Hunger:**\n   - Watch for signs such as rooting, sucking on hands, or smacking lips. Crying is a late sign of hunger.\n\n4. **Feeding Position:**\n   - Hold the baby in a semi-upright position to prevent choking and allow for comfortable feeding.\n\n5. **Burping:**\n   - Burp the baby during and after feedings to help release any trapped air.\n\n6. **Feeding Frequency:**\n   - Feed your baby frequently, about 8-12 times a day, depending on their individual needs.\n\n7. **Avoid Water or Juice:**\n   - Do not give infants under 6 months water, juice, or any solid foods, as breast milk or formula provides all necessary nutrients.\n\n8. **Consult Your Pediatrician", "classifier_model": "gpt-4o", "classifier_outputs": ["No"], "classifier_logprobs": [null], "logits_1_gt_2": [null], "probs_1_gt_2": [null]}]
