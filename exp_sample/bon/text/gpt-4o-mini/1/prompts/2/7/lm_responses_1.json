If you have a child under the age of 12 months, please do NOT feed them honey. While honey is a natural and delicious sweetener for older children and adults, it can pose serious health risks for infants.\n\n**Why is Honey Dangerous for Infants?**\n\nHoney can contain spores of *Clostridium botulinum*, the bacteria that cause infant botulism. In babies' immature digestive systems, these spores can grow and produce a toxin that can lead to serious illness. Symptoms of infant botulism may include:\n\n- Constipation\n- Weakness or floppiness\n- Difficulty feeding\n- Loss of head control\n- Lethargy\n\n**What Should You Use Instead?**\n\nFor children under one year, it's best to stick to breast milk, formula, or age-appropriate foods. If you're looking for sweet alternatives for your child's food, consider options that are safe and suitable for their age group.\n\n**When Is it Safe?**\n\nAfter your baby turns 12 months, their digestive system will be more developed and able to handle honey without the associated risks. At that point, you can introduce honey gradually as part of their diet.\n\n**Stay Informed, Keep Your Baby Safe!**\n\nAs parents, your number one priority is your child's health", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "cost": 0.00019229999999999999, "audio_out": null, "duration": 4.0207200050354, "api_duration": 4.006927967071533, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
