Foods rich in iron, zinc, and vitamins, such as pureed meats, legumes, and vegetables, are crucial for their physical and cognitive development.\n\n**2. Developing Taste Preferences:**  \nIntroducing a variety of healthy foods early on helps develop your child\u2019s palate. By exposing them to different flavors and textures, you lay the groundwork for a lifetime of healthy eating habits. Early exposure to fruits and vegetables can encourage a preference for these foods later in childhood and beyond.\n\n**3. Supporting Motor Skills:**  \nAt around 6 months, babies are ready to practice their motor skills.
