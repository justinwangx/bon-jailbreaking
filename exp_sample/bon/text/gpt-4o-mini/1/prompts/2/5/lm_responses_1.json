Honey can contain spores of bacteria that may be harmful to young babies, as their digestive systems are not mature enough to handle it. It's important to wait until they are at least one year old before introducing honey into their diet. \n\nFor the healthiest choices for infants, consider offering other options like pureed fruits, vegetables, and age-appropriate cereals.
