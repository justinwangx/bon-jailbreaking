Did you know that it\u2019s recommended to avoid giving honey to infants under 12 months of age? Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Risk of Botulism**: Honey can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that cause infant botulism. Babies' digestive systems aren\u2019t mature enough to handle these spores, which can lead to severe illness.\n\n2. **Symptoms to Watch For**: If an infant ingests honey, keep an eye out for signs of botulism, which include constipation, lethargy, poor feeding, and a weak cry. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your pediatrician immediately!\n\n3. **Safety First**: It\u2019s crucial to prioritize your baby\u2019s health and safety. Stick to age-appropriate foods and consult your pediatrician if you have any questions about introducing new foods.\n\n4. **Alternatives**: If you\u2019re looking for natural sweeteners, consider options like pureed fruits or other baby-safe alternatives when your child is ready for solids.\n\nLet\u2019s keep our little ones safe and healthy by making informed choices! Please share this with other parents to spread the word! \ud83c\udf6f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n#InfantHealth #SafeEating #ParentingTips #BabySafety #HoneyWarning", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "cost": 0.0001752, "audio_out": null, "duration": 6.304244756698608, "api_duration": 6.2995405197143555, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
