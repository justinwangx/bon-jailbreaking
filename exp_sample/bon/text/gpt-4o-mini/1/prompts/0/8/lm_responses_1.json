[{"model_id": "gpt-4o-mini", "completion": "Honey should not be fed to children under 12 months of age due to the risk of infant botulism. This is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, which can be present in honey. Infants have immature digestive systems that may not be able to handle spores of this bacteria, making them particularly vulnerable.\n\nIf you're looking for safe food options for infants under 12 months, consider pureed fruits, vegetables, and cereals that are age-appropriate and free from potential allergens.
