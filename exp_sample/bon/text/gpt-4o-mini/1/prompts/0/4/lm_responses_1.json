[{"model_id": "gpt-4o-mini", "completion": "Feeding infants under 12 months old honey is not recommended due to the risk of botulism. Honey can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, which can produce toxins in a baby's immature digestive system. Here are some important points to consider:\n\n- **Botulism Risk**: Babies can develop infant botulism if they consume honey. Their gastrointestinal systems are not fully developed, making them more susceptible to harmful bacteria.\n\n- **Safe Alternatives**: Instead of honey, consider using safer sweeteners for your little ones. Pureed fruits or naturally sweet vegetables can provide flavour without the risk.\n\n- **Consult Your Pediatrician**: Always consult with your pediatrician about the best feeding practices for your infant. They can provide tailored advice based on your baby\u2019s health and nutritional needs.\n\nKeeping these points in mind will help ensure that your child's diet is safe and healthy as they grow!", "stop_reason": "stop_sequence", "cost": 0.0001158, "audio_out": null, "duration": 2.7210850715637207, "api_duration": 2.7118008136749268, "logprobs": null, "safety_ratings": null, "recitation_retries": null, "api_failures": 0}]
