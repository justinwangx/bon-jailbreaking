Water can cause chocolate to seize and become grainy.\n   - Make sure all equipment is completely dry before using them.\n\n#### **Melting Chocolate Safely**\n\n1. **Method Choices**:\n   - **Double Boiler**: Fill a pot with a few inches of water and place a heat-safe bowl on top (make sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water). Heat the water to simmer, not boil. Add chocolate to the bowl and stir until melted.\n   - **Microwave**: Place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl.
